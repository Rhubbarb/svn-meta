release/distribution script

*** verify script
*** hot-copy script
schedule setup scripts (Windows sc?; Linux cron?)

repository structure setup script

implement conditions on deleted lines?
implement regex implies regex for lines?

implement existential lines?

CLIENT_SIDE EDITING SCRIPTS?
* e.g. find and/or apply line-checks

Specify Formatting of errors for line checks?

Post-commit empty message warning?

? check presence of keywords in files (in addition to properties)

? check file encoding? (e.g. 1252 versus UCS-2_LE; e.g. Win v. Unix)

check for final empty line in file
(first line and last line conditions?)

bash-style hook wrappers [and test]
bash-style prepare_environment.sh [and test]

on property checks, define template extension ".tmpl";
check properties of that file type after stripping one layer of extension.

for extensionless files, implement a hash-bang check?

pre-commit (of merge) : check for correctness of position svn:mergeinfo information - how?

implement svn:property subset/superset/intersection configuration option:
	+ mandatory = exact
	+ mandatory <= non-empty subset (non-strict)
	+ mandatory >= superset (non-strict)
	+ mandatory ^= non-empty intersection (one or more alternatives)
	= optional = exact
	= optional <= subset (non-strict)
	= optional >= superset (non-strict)
	= optional ^= non-empty intersection (one or more alternatives)
	- prohibited
implement svn:property alternatives option
	+ mandatory = single value
	+ mandatory |= pipe-separated alternatives (one alternative only)

?Implement duplication detection for globs?
That would be nice in a script.
This is hard, so might only be possible at run-time.

<$check_message_nonempty>
[This could be enhanced to be of a certain minimum length, or to contain certain mandatory words.]

implement a branch obsoleting mechanism?

external options file
e.g.
	[pre-commit]
		check-message-nonempty = 1;
		check-author-and-date-present = 1;
		enable-path-checks = 1;
		enable-property-checks = 1;
		enable-line-checks = 1;
		prevent-double-copying = 1;
		enable-tag-protection = 1;
		prevent-copy-from-tag = 1;
		tagarea = "_tags";
