###############################################################################

### This is usually used to prohibit the addition of
### lines with certain undesirable features.

### The rules are applied to any file scheduled
### for addition or modification.
### When the file operation is with history,
### only changes from the copied file are considered.

### Example uses are to ban trailing whitespace,
### or to restrict leading whitespace to tabs or spaces.

### [To enforce matching line endings,
### instead ensure that files have the svn:eol-style properly set;
### i.e. don't try to enforce that with this configuration file.]

### SYNTAX

### To indicate a section (for certain filename patterns):
### enclose space-separated globs in g<angle brackets> with leading 'g'
### (regexes not supported here)

### Within a section, the first non-whitespace character is:
###   - for a <"description"> in angle brackets and quotes,
###       followed by prohibited pattern
###       expressed as a regex in re<angle brackets> with leading 're'

### Comment lines have a hash (#) as the first non-whitespace character.

###############################################################################

### The following rules are tested in an arbitrary order;
### the globs should be mutually exclusive, but that is not checked.

### 'C' / C++
	g<*.c *.cpp *.h *.hpp *.py *.pl>
		- <"indentation with space"> re <^\s* \s*[^\s]>
		- <"trailing space"> re <\s$>
