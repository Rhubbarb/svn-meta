= Pre-commit Line Configuration <line-config.txt> =

This file may be used to configure the checking of the format or content of lines added or modified under version control.

If a file `<hooks/_hook_config/line-config.txt>` exists in the repository, then that takes precedence (as a whole) over any file `<hooks/hook_config/line-config.txt>` in the common directory.

== Syntax ==

To indicate a section (for certain filename patterns), enclose space-separated globs in g<angle brackets> with leading 'g'; regexes not supported here.

Within a section, the first non-whitespace character is:
 - for a <"description"> in angle brackets and quotes,
   followed by prohibited pattern
   expressed as a regex in re<angle brackets> with leading 're'

Comment lines have a hash (#) as the first non-whitespace character.

== Example Configuration File ==

Note the comment strings in the example, which are used to generate an intelligible error message.

{{{
    ### The following rules are tested in an arbitrary order;
    ### the globs should be mutually exclusive, but that is not checked.

    ### 'C' / C++
      g<*.c *.cpp *.h *.hpp *.py *.pl>
        - <"indentation with space"> re <^\s* \s*[^\s]>
        - <"trailing space"> re <\s$>
