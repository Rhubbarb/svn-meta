#Why this is here

= Introduction =

Having used a Subversion for a few years, and having worked (informally) as a configuration manager at a number of companies, I started to develop this set of configuration files. These have been worked on somewhat intermittently.

Now I work for a company that uses Git. I am still fond of Subversion, but now am unlikely to continue development on this *suite*.

I hope these files will be helpful to someone maintaining or administering a Subversion server.
